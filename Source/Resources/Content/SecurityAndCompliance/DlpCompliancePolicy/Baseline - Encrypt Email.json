  "$description": "| What does this do? | Creates a DLP compliance policy that will automatically encrpyt an email with the word Secure in the subject line. |\n| Why should you use this? | Email message encryption helps ensure that only intended recipients can view message content. This places additional protections on senstive content delivered inside or outside the organization. |\n| What is the end-user impact? | End-Users will likely need some instructions on how to use email encryption within the organization. Depending on how you role it out, they may have to type a specific subject line or leverage a built in plug-in that allows them to encrypt the message on demand. Users will need to open encrypted messages in Outlook on the web vs the email client on the desktop |\n| Learn more | [Message Encrpytion](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/compliance/set-up-new-message-encryption-capabilities?view=o365-worldwide) |",
