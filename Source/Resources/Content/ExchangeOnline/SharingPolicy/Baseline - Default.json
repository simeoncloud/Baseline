It is recommened to whitelist domains on-demand and leave all others blocked. |\n| What is the end-user impact? | With this setting in place, users will not be able to share calendar or contacts to any external domains unless they are whitelisted. A formal request process should be put into place and evaluated when a user needs to share their calendar details.  |\n| Learn more | [Sharing Policies](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/exchange/sharing/sharing-policies/sharing-policies) |",
