Password reset must be configured for all users who are a part of this policy to ensure that they are not locked out of their accounts. |\n| Learn more | [User risk policy](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/identity-protection/concept-identity-protection-policies#user-risk-policy) |",
