The group Baseline - Unrestricted Access From Unmanaged Devices And Untrusted Locations is excluded from this policy. Since this policy is so restrictive, it will be created in a report-only state. |\n| Why should you use this? | Only compliant, managed devices should be allowed to access corporate resources. |\n| What is the end-user impact? | <span style='color: red'>High Impact.</span> Users will not be able to login to their account on devices not enrolled into Intune and in a “Compliant” state. |\n| Learn more | [Require a compliant device](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/conditional-access/howto-conditional-access-policy-compliant-device#create-a-conditional-access-policy) |",
