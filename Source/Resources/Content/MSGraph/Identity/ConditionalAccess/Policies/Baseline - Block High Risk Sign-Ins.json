  "$description": "| What does this do? | Sign-ins detected as high risk are to be blocked via Conditional Access. |\n| Why should you use this? | Azure AD Identity Protection uses various signals to detect the risk level for each sign-in. High risk sign-ins should not be blocked until further investigation. |\n| What is the end-user impact? | <span style='color: red'>High Impact.</span> Once a respective conditional access policy is implemented, if a high-risk user attempts to login, the user will receive an error message with instructions to contact the administrator to re-enable their access |\n| Learn more | [Create Risk Policies](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/conditional-access/howto-conditional-access-policy-risk) |",
