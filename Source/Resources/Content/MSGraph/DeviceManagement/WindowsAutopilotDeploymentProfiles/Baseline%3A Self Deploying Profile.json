  "$description": "| What does this do? | Creates an Intune Autopilot profile for enrolling machines using the self-deploying method, which enables a device to be enrolled into your environment with little to no user interaction. Self-deployment mode comes with restrictions including that the device must have TPM 2.0, and it is not supported on virtual machines even if they have a virtual TPM. Devices in the Azure AD group \"Baseline - Autopilot Devices - Self Deploying\" will be assigned this profile. |\n| Why should you use this? | This is most useful for devices that will be shared or used as a kiosk. If a device is going to be used by a single user it is best to use the user-driven method. |\n| What is the end-user impact? | User devices assigned to this profile can be configured using the self-deployment method. |\n| Learn more | [Windows Autopilot Self-Deploying mode](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/mem/autopilot/self-deploying) |",
