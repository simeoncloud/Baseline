    "$description": "| What does this do? | Defines the required state that a device for an iOS/iPad device must be in to be considered compliant before accessing an organization's data. The baseline requires that a device is not jailbroken and prevents simple passwords. It also requires a managed email profile on the device and a threat protection level at or below medium. This policy applies to all devices in the Azure AD group \"Baseline - Corporate Apple Devices\". |\n| Why should you use this? | This ensures your managed iOS/iPad devices meet a minimum level of security to access data. |\n| What is the end-user impact? | Users may access an organization's data only if the device meets the conditions specified in the policy. The user will have to choose a new password every 45 days. They will also have to set up a managed email profile if it is not already configured on the device. |\n| Learn more | [Use compliance policies to set rules for devices you manage with Intune](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/mem/intune/protect/compliance-policy-create-ios) |",
