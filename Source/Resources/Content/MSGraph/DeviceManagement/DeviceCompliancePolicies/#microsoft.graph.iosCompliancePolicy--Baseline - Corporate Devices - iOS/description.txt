| What does this do? | Defines the required state that a device for an iOS/iPad device must be in to be considered compliant before accessing an organization's data. The baseline requires that a device is not jailbroken and prevents simple passwords. It also requires a managed email profile on the device and a threat protection level at or below medium. This policy applies to all devices in the Azure AD group "Baseline - Corporate Devices - Apple". |
| Why should you use this? | This ensures your managed iOS/iPad devices meet a minimum level of security to access data. |
| What is the end-user impact? | Users may access an organization's data only if the device meets the conditions specified in the policy. The user will have to choose a new password every 45 days. They will also have to set up a managed email profile if it is not already configured on the device. |
