    "$description": "| What does this do? | Limits the maximum number of Entra joined/registered devices per user (recommended ≤20) and prevents the Global Administrator role from being added as a local administrator during Entra join. |\n| Why should you use this? | Reduces attacker persistence via excessive device registrations and enforces least privilege on devices to lower compromise impact. |\n| What is the end-user impact? | Users cannot register more devices after reaching the quota; admins must use Device Enrollment Manager for bulk enrollments and use designated local admin accounts instead of Global Admins (minor administrative overhead). |\n| Learn more | [Manage device settings in Microsoft Entra ID](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/devices/manage-device-settings) [Manage local administrators on Azure AD joined devices](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/devices/manage-local-accounts) |",
