The baseline allows only the groups \"Baseline - Device Enrollers\" and \"Baseline - Microsoft 365 Users\" to join devices to Azure AD. These groups may join up to 100 devices and are required to perform MFA when joining the device. |\n| Why should you use this? | If you want to restrict the ability to join devices to Azure AD to only authorized groups and require MFA. |\n| What is the end-user impact? | <span style='color: red'>High Impact.</span> Only authorized groups may join devices, and users in those groups will be prompted for MFA to join. |\n| Learn more | N/A |",
