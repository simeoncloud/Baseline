  "$description": "| What does this do? | Creates a dynamic device group that is used to assign the \"Baseline - User Driven Profile\" Autopilot profile to devices. This group includes all devices that are not in the Azure AD group \"Baseline - Autopilot Devices - Self Deploying.\" |\n| Why should you use this? | When a device is going to be used by a single user, this approach is ideal because the device shows as assigned in all relevant Intune pages and reports. It is also the most stable and consistent Autopilot mode. |\n| What is the end-user impact? | Devices with this profile can be Autopiloted by users themselves. The device will be registered to the user and the user will be able to use the company portal application. |\n| Learn more | [Windows Autopilot User-Driven mode](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/mem/autopilot/user-driven) |",
